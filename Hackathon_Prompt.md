# Hack for the Environment

## Scenario:


You’ve been called here today by the United Nations. They’ve realized that there is an urgent need to further conservation and sustainability efforts using technology, but are struggling to figure out how. They’ve called an emergency meeting of some of the brightest minds in the world to come together and build these solutions. You will have three days to build a smart camera that will use AI to further conservation and sustainability efforts in a new impactful way.

At the end of this period your team will live demo the solution you’ve built and pitch it to the United Nations. A select committee of technologists will be watching these pitches and deciding which project will receive funding. You should have been assigned to your team already. Good luck, the stakes are high.

## Challenge:

Each team will need to successfully do two things to win the challenge: build their smart camera system [using this tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QWyySi4Fz543bMFVJEPKA5uvKi3_zRqeX4Uf5NCq7pM/edit?usp=sharing) and then build a solution using this smart camera to promote conservation sustainability. Your solutions will be judged on their technical merit, creativity, and impact. You will be judged on a pitch that is a maximum of 10 minutes that must include a live demo. The pitch should include slides on:

​​**1. What is the problem?** How big is the problem? Why is there a need for your solution NOW? Use Numbers.

**2. What is your solution** – explained in words (elevator pitch)

**3. (3 minutes) Demo**

**4. Impact at Scale** – If you succeeded how big would the change be?

**5. Cost of Implementation**


## Rules:



1. Work must stop at the end of the hackathon. No working on your project past **2pm on Sunday.**
2. You may use any tools or methods that other teams could also reasonably access, but you must **cite your sources** of where the code, data, etc. came from.
3. You must add your algorithm, pitch presentation (Powerpoint, google slides, or apple pages), and any other code or content you’ve created to your team’s submission folder.
4. **No copying** other teams’ work. You may have similar ideas, but no intentional copying unless you have the team’s permission.
5. The presentations will be judged on the following criteria:
    1. Collaborative Spirit: Respect, Collaboration, and Curiosity (5)
    2. Completeness of PI + AI Implementation (3)
    3. Creativity of Solution (15)
        1. Creativity of Solution
        2. Creativity in use of Data
        3. Creativity in Pushing Knowledge Beyond what you Learned
    4. Impact (15)
        4. Scalability of your solution
        5. Cost of Implementation
        6. Significance
    5. Accuracy of Implementation (Algorithm) (15)

## Awards

Each of the winning team members will get to keep one of the Raspberry Pi setups!

There will be one Raspberry Pi system awarded to the individual that is the best collaborator. Examples of what we are looking for are: working with your group to make sure everyone is learning, not just one person doing everything; helping distribute the tasks on your team evenly; and going above and beyond to create an environment where we can work hard and build great technology.
